# Deep Learning Pneumonia Classifier
 
Using CNNs to make a model that can predict if an x-ray image has a pneumonia or not. The dataset contains almost 6000 images which is split into 5200 images for training, 600 for testing and 16 for validation. The model consists of 3 convolution layers and 2 max pooling layers with 3 dropout layers. Currently, the model is still a work in progress, hindered by lack of computation power i.e. the training time is too long. Will be updated soon with a result.
